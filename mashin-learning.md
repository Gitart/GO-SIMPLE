   2. Machine Learning libraries for Go Lang : <https://github.com/alonsovidales/go_ml>: Implemented Algorithms include Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Collaborative Filtering & Gaussian Multivariate Distribution for anomaly detection systems
   3. MLGo - <https://code.google.com/p/mlgo/> - Algorithms implemented include Gaussian mixture model, k-means, k-medians, k-medoids, single-linkage hierarchical clustering
   4. [GoLearn](https://github.com/sjwhitworth/golearn): - GoLearn is a 'batteries included' machine learning library for Go. Simplicity, paired with customisability, is the goal.
3. Neural Networks
4. 1. Neural Networks written in go : <https://github.com/goml/gobrain>
   2. Go Fann - <https://github.com/white-pony/go-fann> - Go bindings for FANN, library for artificial neural networks
   3. <https://github.com/schuyler/neural-go> - Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network
   4. Genetic Algorithms library written in Go / golang - <https://github.com/thoj/go-galib>
   5. Word2Vec, GloVe in Go : [https://github.com/ynqa/wego](https://github.com/ynqa/word-embedding)
5. Linear Algebra:
6. 1. [Linear Algebra for Go & Matrix Library](https://github.com/skelterjohn/go.matrix):
   2. [Mat64](http://godoc.org/github.com/gonum/matrix/mat64): Package mat64 provides basic linear algebra operations for float64 matrices. mat64 provides a set of concrete types that implement different classes of matrices (Dense, Symmetric, etc.) and operations on them. In most cases, an operation which results in a matrix value is a method on the value being produced.
   3. [BLAS Implementation for Go](https://github.com/gonum/blas): The BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are routines that provide standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix operations
   4. <https://github.com/danieldk/golinear> - liblinear bindings for Go
   5. <https://github.com/james-bowman/sparse> - Sparse matrix formats for Go
7. Probability Distribution Functions
8. 1. <http://godoc.org/code.google.com/p/probab>
   2. <https://github.com/e-dard/godist>
9. Decision Trees:
10. 1. Hector <https://github.com/xlvector/hector> - Golang machine learning lib. Currently, it can be used to solve binary classification problems.Logistic Regression , Factorized Machine , CART, Random Forest, Random Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree & Neural Network
    2. Decision Trees in Go - <https://github.com/ajtulloch/decisiontrees> - Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, etc. implemented in Go
    3. CloudForest - <https://github.com/ryanbressler/CloudForest> - Fast, flexible, multi-threaded ensembles of decision trees for machine learning in pure Go (golang).
