Welcome to [**Just Enough Go**](https://medium.com/@abhishek1987/just-enough-go-blog-series-c1cd62b04beb) - a series of articles about the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/) in which I will be covering some of most commonly used [Go standard library packages](https://golang.org/pkg) e.g. `encoding/json`, `io`, `net/http`, `sync` etc. I plan to keep these relatively short and example driven.

I would be more than happy to take suggestions on specific Go topics which you would like to me cover! Feel free to [tweet](https://twitter.com/abhi_tweeter) your suggestions  ðŸ˜ƒ
