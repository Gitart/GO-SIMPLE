# How do I troubleshoot common issues when using Colly?

Colly is a popular scraping framework for Golang, designed to simplify the process of extracting data from websites. When using Colly, you might encounter various issues, such as unexpected errors, blocked requests, or incomplete data extraction. Here are some common troubleshooting steps to help you address these issues:

### 1. Debugging Output

Colly has built-in debugging capabilities. You can enable the debugger to get detailed information about the requests and responses:

Copy

```go
// Enable the debugger by attaching the default logger
c := colly.NewCollector(
    colly.Debugger(&debug.LogDebugger{}),
)
```

This will output detailed logs to the console, which can help you understand what's happening under the hood.

### 2. Error Handling

Always ensure you have error handlers in place to catch and diagnose any issues that arise:

Copy

```go
c.OnError(func(r *colly.Response, err error) {
    fmt.Println("Request URL:", r.Request.URL, "failed with response:", r, "\nError:", err)
})
```

### 3. Check for Blocked Requests

Websites might block your requests if they detect unusual behavior (e.g., too many requests from the same IP in a short period). To troubleshoot this:

* Slow down your requests using `Limit` rules.
* Rotate user agents.
* Use proxy servers.

Copy

```go
// Set up rate limit
err := c.Limit(&colly.LimitRule{
    DomainGlob:  "*",
    Parallelism: 1,
    Delay:       5 * time.Second,
})

// Rotate User Agents
c.UserAgent = "AnotherUserAgentString"

// Use a Proxy
c.SetProxy("http://myproxy.com:3128")
```

### 4. Inspect the Response

If you're not getting the data you expect, inspect the raw response:

Copy

```go
c.OnResponse(func(r *colly.Response) {
    fmt.Println("Visited", r.Request.URL)
    fmt.Println("Response", string(r.Body))
})
```

### 5. Check for JavaScript

If the content you're scraping is loaded via JavaScript, Colly won't be able to see it since it doesn't process JavaScript. You can:

* Look for API calls in the browser's network tab and scrape the API directly.
* Use a tool like Chromedp or go-rod to render JavaScript before scraping.

### 6. Element Selectors

Ensure your selectors are correct. If you're not getting the expected elements:

* Double-check your selectors.
* Make sure the elements exist in the raw HTML response.
* Use the browser's developer tools to validate your selectors.

### 7. Handling Redirects

Colly follows redirects by default. If you want to control this behavior, you can disable automatic redirects:

Copy

```go
c.WithTransport(&http.Transport{
    DisableKeepAlives: true,
    Proxy: http.ProxyFromEnvironment,
    DialContext: (&net.Dialer{
        Timeout:   30 * time.Second,
        KeepAlive: 30 * time.Second,
        DualStack: true,
    }).DialContext,
    ForceAttemptHTTP2:     true,
    MaxIdleConns:          100,
    IdleConnTimeout:       90 * time.Second,
    TLSHandshakeTimeout:   10 * time.Second,
    ExpectContinueTimeout: 1 * time.Second,
})
```

### 8. Cookies and Sessions

If the site uses cookies or sessions to manage state, make sure you're preserving them between requests:

Copy

```go
// This will get called for each request
c.OnRequest(func(r *colly.Request) {
    // Set cookies
    r.Headers.Set("Cookie", "name=value")
})
```

### 9. Captchas and JavaScript Challenges

Some sites have captchas or JavaScript challenges to block scrapers. Handling these requires more advanced techniques like captcha solving services or headless browsers.

### 10. Check for Legal Compliance

Ensure that your scraping activities comply with the website's `robots.txt` file, terms of service, and legal regulations.

### Conclusion

When troubleshooting Colly, the key is to gather as much information as possible about the issue you're facing. Use the debugging techniques mentioned above, inspect the responses thoroughly, and make sure you're adhering to the site's scraping policies. If you're still stuck, consider reaching out to the community or checking the official Colly documentation for more insights.
