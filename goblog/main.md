# The Best Golang Blogs

[#go](https://dev.to/t/go) [#blogs](https://dev.to/t/blogs)

Go recently turned eleven, so you can imagine how much the language and its ecosystem have evolved through the years. A strongly typed language, it’s become increasingly popular with its garbage collection and concurrency support. It’s massively performant, scalable, and resource-use efficient. Small wonder that Go is applied across a multitude of areas these days, including web applications, microservices, cloud computing, web servers, and other systems/tools.

A good way to stay on top of the constant changes to the language, its tools, and the community is to check out some of the blogs that specifically cover Go. In this article, we’ll look at blogs written by Go users, contributors, and educators about the various ways they are making use of the language.

A Journey with Go is a fairly new blog, with its first post in 2019. It tends to stick with a concept over a series of posts explaining it in detail. Interesting series you can find on the blog cover [garbage collection](https://medium.com/a-journey-with-go/tagged/garbage-collector), [the compiler](https://medium.com/a-journey-with-go/tagged/compilers), and many more. It is written by [Vincent Blanchon](https://twitter.com/blanchonvincent) and is hosted on Medium.

Keeping up with Go blogs is a smart way to stay exposed to how others are using Go to solve problems. There is so much Go content out there, and it’s not just limited to blogs; more and more people are turning to video and audio to share their Go content, not to mention all the Go forums and newsletters that are available.

There’s always something new to learn about Go, and better or more interesting ways to work with it are always popping up. If you know of other Go blogs we should include in this list, [submit them here](https://airtable.com/shrKNdNjYO6hNQxJV).
