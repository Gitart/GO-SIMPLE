# Golang Maps

In this tutorial you will learn what is a map data type and when to use it in Golang.

A map is a data structure that provides you with an unordered collection of key/value pairs (maps are also sometimes called associative arrays in Php, hash tables in Java, or dictionaries in Python). Maps are used to look up a value by its associated key. You store values into the map based on a key.

The strength of a map is its ability to retrieve data quickly based on the key. A key works like an index, pointing to the value you associate with that key.

A map is implemented using a hash table, which is providing faster lookups on the data element and you can easily retrieve a value by providing the key. Maps are unordered collections, and there's no way to predict the order in which the key/value pairs will be returned. Every iteration over a map could return a different order.

### Map initialization

In Golang maps are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values. Creating an instance of a map data type.

package main

import "fmt"

var employee = map\[string\]int{"Mark": 10, "Sandy": 20}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(employee)
}

---

### Empty Map declaration

Map employee created having string as key\-type and int as value\-type

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var employee = map\[string\]int{}
	fmt.Println(employee)        // map\[\]
	fmt.Printf("%T\\n", employee) // map\[string\]int
}

---

### Map declaration using make function

The make function takes as argument the type of the map and it returns an initialized map.

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var employee = make(map\[string\]int)
	employee\["Mark"\] = 10
	employee\["Sandy"\] = 20
	fmt.Println(employee)

	employeeList := make(map\[string\]int)
	employeeList\["Mark"\] = 10
	employeeList\["Sandy"\] = 20
	fmt.Println(employeeList)
}

---

### Map Length

To determine how many items (key\-value pairs) a map has, use built\-in len() function.

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var employee = make(map\[string\]int)
	employee\["Mark"\] = 10
	employee\["Sandy"\] = 20

	// Empty Map
	employeeList := make(map\[string\]int)

	fmt.Println(len(employee))     // 2
	fmt.Println(len(employeeList)) // 0
}

The len() function will return zero for an uninitialized map.

---

### Accessing Items

You can access the items of a map by referring to its key name, inside square brackets.

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var employee = map\[string\]int{"Mark": 10, "Sandy": 20}

	fmt.Println(employee\["Mark"\])
}

Get the value of the "Mark" key.

---

### Adding Items

Adding an item to the map is done by using a new index key and assigning a value to it.

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var employee = map\[string\]int{"Mark": 10, "Sandy": 20}
	fmt.Println(employee) // Initial Map

	employee\["Rocky"\] = 30 // Add element
	employee\["Josef"\] = 40

	fmt.Println(employee)
}

---

### Update Values

You can update the value of a specific item by referring to its key name.

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var employee = map\[string\]int{"Mark": 10, "Sandy": 20}
	fmt.Println(employee) // Initial Map

	employee\["Mark"\] = 50 // Edit item
	fmt.Println(employee)
}

Changed the "Mark" to 50

---

### Delete Items

The built\-in delete function deletes an item from a given map associated with the provided key.

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var employee = make(map\[string\]int)
	employee\["Mark"\] = 10
	employee\["Sandy"\] = 20
	employee\["Rocky"\] = 30
	employee\["Josef"\] = 40

	fmt.Println(employee)

	delete(employee, "Mark")
	fmt.Println(employee)
}

---

### Iterate over a Map

The forâ€¦range loop statement can be used to fetch the index and element of a map.

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var employee = map\[string\]int{"Mark": 10, "Sandy": 20,
        "Rocky": 30, "Rajiv": 40, "Kate": 50}
    for key, element := range employee {
        fmt.Println("Key:", key, "=>", "Element:", element)
    }
}

Each iteration returns a key and its correlated element content.

---

### Truncate Map

There are two methods to clear all items from a Map.

package main

func main() {
	var employee = map\[string\]int{"Mark": 10, "Sandy": 20,
		"Rocky": 30, "Rajiv": 40, "Kate": 50}

	// Method \- I
	for k := range employee {
		delete(employee, k)
	}

	// Method \- II
	employee = make(map\[string\]int)
}

---

### Sort Map Keys

A Keys slice created to store keys value of map and then sort the slice. The sorted slice used to print values of map in key order.

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sort"
)

func main() {
	unSortedMap := map\[string\]int{"India": 20, "Canada": 70, "Germany": 15}

	keys := make(\[\]string, 0, len(unSortedMap))

	for k := range unSortedMap {
		keys = append(keys, k)
	}
	sort.Strings(keys)

	for \_, k := range keys {
		fmt.Println(k, unSortedMap\[k\])
	}
}

---

### Sort Map Values

To sort the key values of a map, you need to store them in Slice and then sort the slice.

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sort"
)

func main() {
	unSortedMap := map\[string\]int{"India": 20, "Canada": 70, "Germany": 15}

 // Int slice to store values of map.
	values := make(\[\]int, 0, len(unSortedMap))

	for \_, v := range unSortedMap {
		values = append(values, v)
	}

 // Sort slice values.
	sort.Ints(values)

 // Print values of sorted Slice.
	for \_, v := range values {
		fmt.Println(v)
	}
}

---

### Merge Maps

The keys and values of second map getting added in first map.

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	first := map\[string\]int{"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
	second := map\[string\]int{"a": 1, "e": 5, "c": 3, "d": 4}

	for k, v := range second {
		first\[k\] = v
	}

	fmt.Println(first)
}
